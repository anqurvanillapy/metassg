**Posting Protocol**, SSG (Static site generator) abstract class for extensible
use.

Test
----

**Postocol** doesn't use any third-party testing libraries, for the built-in
`unittest` is decent for testing its basic functionality, which is able to be
used from the command line.

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest
$ python3 -m unittest -v # show verbose of the test suite
```
